# Cave-Story-Remake
I am developing 2-d platformer cave story 
Code is designed and written by me
Graphics are taken from fan website cavestory.org

Visual Studio is recommended to compile and run the code
All the dependencies are within this repository
You need to add paths to library and include files in Visual Studio setting, for refrence use the following link : (https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-vc.php)
You also need to add the following libraries sfml-graphics-s.lib, sfml-window-s.lib, sfml-system-s.lib, opengl32.lib, freetype.lib, winmm.lib
In sfml libraries if you want to use debug libraries just add -d as suffix in sfml libraries mentioned in point 9
Make sure to select x86 32 bit application
That's it you can enjoy the game
