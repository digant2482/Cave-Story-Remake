# Cave-Story-Remake
I am developing a 2-D platformer cave story 
* The code is designed and written by me
* Graphics are taken from the fan website cavestory.org
Visual Studio is recommended for compiling and running the code
All the dependencies are within this repository 
You need to add paths to the library and include files in the Visual Studio setting, for reference use the following link : (https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-vc.php)
You also need to add the following libraries sfml-graphics-s.lib, sfml-window-s.lib, sfml-system-s.lib, opengl32.lib, freetype.lib, winmm.lib
In some libraries if you want to use debug libraries add -d as a suffix in sfml libraries mentioned in point 9
Make sure to select the x86 32-bit application
That's it you can enjoy the game
